I have implemented tic tac toe using a singly linked list in java.
creating each node and the methods needed to run a linked list
run the code and enter a number between and nine
the code assigns each node with a number and fills the previously blank space with whoevers turn it is either an X or O

some difficulties I experienced were half the code was already implemented and the game board was checking for "" quotes with no space and my code was looking for a " " pair of quotes with a space
  this was a small but crucial problem to identify
Another problem i ran into was all the methods had to be implemented in order to get a proper response from the terminal, so it was hard to check my progress as I went along until everything was filled in
The final issue came from the check winning conditions method, which continually printed "it's a tie" before the game even started.
  after watching multiple youtube videos and more research I was able to adjust the method to not jump to the game being over
